    "This project was very fun to make and is pretty good for finding similar movies. It could be improved if it weighted the words that appeared by their rarity. The current search finds the number of words shared by the query and the description. This approach is simple and effective for short-medium queries, but is drowned out by common words when queries get longer. Using weighted words would ensure that rare words from queries/descriptions are matchted."
